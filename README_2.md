# Multi-Database Synchronization System with RAM-Based Operation History

## Overview

This project implements a synchronization system for **multiple heterogeneous databases** such as **MongoDB, Hive, PostgreSQL**, etc. It maintains a **temporary memory layer (RAM)** for each database that logs all operations with support for **undo, rollback, merge, and commit** features.

The system ensures consistency and extensibility across databases while maintaining an efficient operation history. Multi-threading and operation logs are also incorporated for performance and traceability.

## Core Components

### 1. Databases Supported

- MongoDB  
- Hive  
- PostgreSQL  

> **Extensible** to other databases with custom connectors.

### 2. 🗂️ Data Structure

Each database maintains entries with the following structure:

| Field      | Description                  |
|------------|------------------------------|
| student ID | Primary key (part of key)    |
| course ID  | Primary key (part of key)    |
| grade      | Value associated with key    |

> **Key** = (student ID, course ID)

## RAM-Based Temporary Memory Layer

### 1. Motivation

Inspired by **system RAM**, changes are staged here before being committed to disk. This allows for:

- Fast write operations  
- Rollbacks  
- Undo capabilities  

### 2. Structure

Each database has a corresponding **RAM**, a `map or dictionary` of:

```python
Dict[Tuple[student_id, course_id], List[Tuple[grade, timestamp, delete_flag]]]
```
